### YouTube censors Rebel News, causing $400,000 loss

**Toronto, Canada** *24 March 2021* Legacy media empire [YouTube](https://youtube.com) demonetized roots media organization [Rebel News](https://www.rebelnews.com/) yesterday without
explaining why. According to the Rebel News [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB6Lg9s6vhc) on YouTube by publisher Ezra Levant,
the projected drop in revenue is about $400,000, or about seven staff positions. The reason given by YouTube was, Levant said, "harm [sic] and dangerous acts",
for example, extreme parkour and street acrobatics. Rebel News covers policy, never coming remotely close to such subjects.

Levant said he expected YouTube knew exactly what the financial burden would be, and cited the recent Buzzfeed layoffs in a similar position. 
He decided to take a different approach. "There's no way I'm going to take Door 1, which is stop criticizing the lockdown, " 
says Levant.  "There's no way I'm going to take Door 2, which is lay off 400 grand worth of staff. So door 3 to me, is: crowdfund it."
Rebel News has set up a crowdfunding page at [AfterYouTube.com](https://www.rebelnews.com/after_youtube_signup).
